<h3> 19.07.2009: OpenCSG 1.1.1 released</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-1.1.1.tar.gz">OpenCSG 1.1.1</a>
is a maintenance release. Issues in the makefiles for Linux
and portability problems for 64-bit Linux have been resolved. Additionally,
a performance problem was fixed in the case of lots of CSG primitives
(several 10000s) with standard bounding boxes. Rendering this is slow
anyways, but before, the rendering time was dominated by the computation
time for generating the batches of primitives. This was, without bounding boxes,
wasted time, because the batches are trivial anyways. 
</p>

<h3> 03.12.2006: OpenCSG 1.1.0 with Frame Buffer Object Support</h3>

<p>
The most significant addition in <a href="http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-1.1.0.tar.gz">OpenCSG-1.1.0</a> is the support of OpenGL frame buffer objects. This
change also led to the option setter and getter functions to control this
and all other rendering options. Additionally several bugs have been fixed,
for example in the heuristics that choses the offscreen buffer size and
rendering errors that occured on some low-end graphics hardware.
</p>

<h3> 03.07.2005: FREENIX 2005 Paper on OpenCSG</h3>

<p>
Since some time, the paper is available for download at directly from 
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/tech/freenix/kirsch.html"> 
USENIX</a> (which requires a USENIX account for some time), or
<a href="publications.html#freenix">
here</a>, where also my talk can be downloaded.
</p>

<h3> 18.12.2004: To appear: FREENIX 2005 Paper on OpenCSG</h3>

<p>
I am going to present the paper <strong><a href="publications.html#freenix">
OpenCSG: A Library for Image-Based CSG Rendering</a></strong> 
on the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/cfp/freenix.html">FREENIX Track</a>
 of the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05">USENIX Annual Technical Conference 2005</a>
 in Anaheim, Californien.
This paper contains a short description of the Goldfeather and the SCS algorithm. It then
explains how (and why so) the API of OpenCSG was designed, outlines the basic implementation
and problems encountered during the implementation. Finally it describes some examples of
its use.
</p>

<h3> 04.12.2004: OpenCSG version 1.0.2 released</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-1.0.2.zip">OpenCSG-1.0.2</a> provides a workspace
for the free, gcc-based <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">Dev-C++ 5</a>
compiler for Windows. Additionally it fixes two bugs, one in the
RenderTexture library, and one bug in the heuristic for choosing
the CSG rendering algorithm, which caused that, under circumstances,
a non-optimal rendering algorithm was used.
</p>

<h3> 27.09.2004: OpenCSG version 1.0.1 released</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-1.0.1.zip">
OpenCSG-1.0.1</a> contains the following changes:
</p>
<p>
The settings of the OpenGL scissor test are now respected
(Former versions just ignored the settings of the scissor test.).
For certain cases, this can lead to a substantial performance gain.
Note that this change could, potentially, cause compatibility
problems in the unlikely case that your application uses the
scissor test when invoking CSG rendering, but actually does not want 
scissoring to be active for CSG rendering. The bug fix for this
case is just to disable scissoring.
</p>
<p>
Besides, OpenCSG now uses the new 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104004&amp;package_id=115053">
RenderTexture version 2</a> that has superseded the older version. As before,
I had to apply some minor patches to RenderTexture for correct functionality under
Linux.
</p>
<p>
The interface of OpenCSG has remained unchanged.
</p>
<p>
I have also updated some sections on the web and added a short FAQ section.
</p>

<h3> 06.07.2004: Download problems are gone</h3>

<p>
The download problems have been resolved for some time now (as you probably guessed ...)
However, I have kept the download place for OpenCSG 1.0.0 here, because my bandwidth 
currently seems to be sufficient.
</p>

<h3> 23.05.2004: Download address of OpenCSG source has temporarily changed</h3>

<p>
Downloading OpenCSG has not been possible during the past few days due to server problems. 
Therefore I have copied the version 1.0.0 temporarily onto this server, so it
is possible to download the current version of OpenCSG again.
Older versions of OpenCSG currently are not accessible in the moment. 
Sorry for any inconveniences.
</p>

<h3> 02.05.2004: OpenCSG version 1.0.0 released</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-1.0.0.zip">
OpenCSG-1.0.0</a> contains lots of improvements and additions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The makefile system for Linux now compiles a shared library.
      The makefiles have been derived by auto-generated makefiles from
      <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/3.0/qmake.html">qmake</a>, but
      of course, qmake (or Qt) is not required to compile OpenCSG. </li>
  <li>Version 1.0.0 contains lots of further performance improvements in
      case the bounding-box for shapes is set. This includes a performance
      bug fix, i.e., formerly scissoring was set to non-optimal values.
      Also, calculating the depth complexity now also considers the bounding
      box values. </li>
  <li>If available, the GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV texture format is now 
      used even in case of power-of-two textures, because this format
      appears to be generally faster. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The interface of OpenCSG has remained unchanged.
</p>

<h3> 02.03.2004: OpenCSG version 0.9.2 released</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-0.9.2.zip">
OpenCSG-0.9.2</a> brings some improvements compared to former versions.
First, for occlusion queries the newer OpenGL-extension GL_ARB_occlusion_query
is now supported along with the former GL_NV_occlusion_query extension.
Second, OpenCSG comes with <a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW version 1.2.0</a> now.
</p>

<p>
Compared to former versions of OpenCSG, no external interfaces have been changed,
so your applications using OpenCSG should just continue to work with OpenCSG 0.9.2.
</p>

<h3> 04.02.2004: Paper on rendering techniques in OpenCSG</h3>

<p>
I have presented the paper <a href="publications.html#wscg">
<strong>Rendering Techniques for Hardware-Accelerated Image-Based CSG</strong></a> 
on the <a href="http://wscg.zcu.cz/wscg2004/wscg2004.htm">WSCG 2004 conference</a>. 
This paper describes the method that OpenCSG uses to transfer the depth information 
in the temporary z-buffer into the main z-buffer using render-to-texture. The paper
describes also how occlusion queries can be used to speed up image-based CSG
rendering. 
</p>

<p>
You can download my <a href="data/csg_wscg2004_talk.pdf">talk</a> already; 
The <a href="http://wscg.zcu.cz/wscg2004/Papers_2004_Full/M11.pdf">paper</a> will be available online as soon as
it is published online by the WSCG.
</p>

<h3> 22.11.2003: OpenCSG version 0.9.1 released</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-0.9.1.zip">
OpenCSG-0.9.1</a> contains a number of improvements and bug fixes.
New features include the ability to work also with the non-standard 
clockwise front-face setting and performance improvements in the case
of constantly changing viewport sizes due to fewer resizes
of the internal pbuffer.
</p>

<p>
Upgrading from version 0.9 to 0.9.1 should be no problem, as the
external interface (and even the hidden internal interfaces)
have not changed.
