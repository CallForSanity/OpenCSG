Compile and start example

-----

1) Just type 'make'. Maybe you must adjust the Makefiles in
   the src/ and the example/ directory for sucessful compilation.
2) The OpenCSG library will have been build in lib/, GLEW in glew/lib/,
   and the example "opencsgexample" will reside in the src/ directory. 
   To run the opencsg example, you must ensure that the GLEW and the 
   OpenCSG libs are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (e.G., one way to do this 
   is to copy them to /usr/local/lib and running "ldconfig -v"). 
   Currently there is no automatic way for this.
