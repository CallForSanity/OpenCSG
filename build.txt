--------------------------------------

To run the example, you must install GLUT or FreeGLUT
Open OpenCSG.dsw / OpenCSG.sln / OpenCSG_vc10.sln
Set OpenCSGexample as active project. In this project, eventually
  adjust include directories such that GL/glut.h is found, and
  adjust library directories such that the glut library file is found.
Compile and start example


Linux
-----

1) Just type 'make'. Maybe you must adjust the Makefiles in
   the src/ and the example/ directory for sucessful compilation.
2) The OpenCSG library will have been build in lib/, GLEW in glew/lib/,
   and the example "opencsgexample" will reside in the src/ directory. 
   To run the opencsg example, you must ensure that the GLEW and the 
   OpenCSG libs are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (e.G., one way to do this 
   is to copy them to /usr/local/lib and running "ldconfig -v"). 
   Currently there is no automatic way for this.
