
02.03.2004
    Release 0.9.2

17.02.2004
    Added: Support for ARB_occlusion_query extension

21.11.2003:
    Release 0.9.1

21.11.2003:
    Fixed: std::max() std::min() issue with .net

18.11.2003:
    Fixed: Bug with heuristic for resizing the pbuffer-resizing
        that occured for request for sizes of the form 512x1024
        -> 1024x512 -> 512x1024 -> ... (and similar series)

06.11.2003: 
    Added: Detection of GL_FRONT_FACE OpenGL setting. This means that
        CSG rendering is now also correct if this setting is the
        non-default clockwise setting.

04.11.2003: 
    Fixed: Stenciling was not disabled in SCS algorithm when 
        subtracting no shapes. This could lead to obscure rendering 
        errors when rendering the next CSG shape. 

02.11.2003: 
    Added: Heuristic that makes the pbuffer smaller 
        if the size of the pbuffer has been bigger than necessary in 
        x- or y- direction for a certain number of render-calles. 
        This permits to use OpenCSG for CSG rendering in different
        canvases with different sizes without constant expensive
        resizing of the pbuffer for every frame.

01.10.2003 
    Fixed: linux: removed accidental linking against tcl/tk  

23.09.2003: 
    Release 0.9
